\section{Development of a cyber-physical system}

A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates computation, networking, and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS is critical in applications like smart grids, autonomous vehicles, medical monitoring, industrial control systems, and robotics. Key characteristics include real-time operation, robustness, and integration of hardware and software components to ensure seamless interaction between the cyber and physical elements.
